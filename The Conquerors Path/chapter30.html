        <p>Chapter 30: Chaos</p>
        <p>currently i was walking carrying Elda and Nora behind Olivia who was leading the way, on the way several people questioned us but Olivia dealt with it perfectly</p>
        <p>walking for a few minutes we reached a huge door without any guards or protection, which made me confused and seeing my seeing my puzzled look Olivia responded coldly</p>
        <p>“there are no guards because there is no need of it, the room can only be opened by someone with the Emperors token or a special bloodline like mine”</p>
        <p>after saying that she made a small wound on her hand and placed it on the door which trembled a bit at first and then it opened</p>
        <p>once the door opened all i could see inside it was just darkness plain darkness, after opening the door Olivia turned to me</p>
        <p>“after entering the door you would be transported inside”</p>
        <p>“after entering the door i don’t care about what happens to you but no harm should come to Nora and Elda”</p>
        <p>saying so she released her mana for intimidation, i scoffed at her and turned to enter with out any fear but while entering it i gave the now dressed Olivia one more spank</p>
        <p>“pakh..”</p>
        <p>“ah~~~❤”</p>
        <p>her flustered expression was indeed quite the sight and before she exploded i entered the room, once i entered it i felt as if I was falling through a void, i felt something scanning through my body seeing through my secrets</p>
        <p>after a while i was brought into a white room, entering it i could see both Elda and Nora on the floor, i rushed upto check them</p>
        <p>“um, whats happening?”</p>
        <p>“ha, bi-big brother where are am i?”</p>
        <p>coming close i saw that both Elda and Nora had woken up but their bodies were totally stiff and their minds in chaos,checking them and seeing their alright i let out a sigh</p>
        <p>“it’s nothing you girl’s don’t need to worry”</p>
        <p>but then suddenly a voice was heard</p>
        <p>“wrong young man they do need to worry”</p>
        <p>suddenly the space fluctuated and a figure was created in front of us, the person who appered was a blonde haired, green eyed handsome middle aged man</p>
        <p>when he appeared i felt as if the world was pressed into me and felt it quite difficult to breath, seeing the person in front of me i was suprised after all i had seen him in some portraits of the palace</p>
        <p>Luke Ezraeil the founder of the Ezraeil Empire, a legendary man to say the least, seeing the person appear both Elda and Nora was surprised, after all they could to identify the person</p>
        <p>“Austin what’s going on?”</p>
        <p>“big brother what’s happening?”</p>
        <p>both Nora and Elda questioned at the same time before i could anwer some one else did</p>
        <p>“you both are here due to awakening your bloodline and are in danger”</p>
        <p>Luke’s word brought silence to both the girl’s as they turned quite, they were smart people themselves, so they could fogure somethings on their own</p>
        <p>“normally when groups enter, according to the program, each of you would be seperated and given individual task”</p>
        <p>“but seeing two descendant girls of my bloodline and a freakishly talented boy, for once i stepped in to intervene”</p>
        <p>saying that he looked towards me</p>
        <p>“boy do you know how surprised I was when i found out you were origin level 3 at just the age of 11?”</p>
        <p>“what !!”</p>
        <p>both Nora and Elda reacted at the same time, according to them their brother should just be origin level 1, after all i never said them about my teacher or my true strength</p>
        <p>“Even back in my time your talent was rare”</p>
        <p>“that’s why i want to ask you, boy do you really want to undergo the trail for all three of you??”</p>
        <p>“trail?, Austin what’s going on here?”</p>
        <p>this time Nora enquired and her expression while asking so didn’t look good to, sighing i went closer to both of them and explained the situation</p>
        <p>i could see both Nora and Elda go pale when they heard about their situation, Elda slowly started crying while Nora was still acting tough</p>
        <p>i pulled Elda into my embrace, who started crying both in fear and sadness, i sat there patting her back to give her some comfort</p>
        <p>“Austin i won’t let you do this”</p>
        <p>Nora was the first to break the silence, she wore a serious expression completely conveying her conviction… but too bad her conviction meant nothing to me right now!!</p>
        <p>i looked directly into hers eyes as if trying to scare her but she just looked straight back at me not even flinching</p>
        <p>this went on for while before i smiled</p>
        <p>“big sister, do you remember what i said to you 3 years ago in our first chess match?”</p>
        <p>my abrut question got her off gaurd, instead of clarifying, i stood up and slowly kept the now pacified Elda down, then i walked towards the ancestor Luke</p>
        <p>“ancestor i want to take the test for both of them”</p>
        <p>“Austin!” “Big brother!”</p>
        <p>neglecting my shouting sister’s i looked towards the ancestor</p>
        <p>“are you sure, i certainly don’t want to see such a talent wasted”</p>
        <p>“i am sure, plus can you do me a favour”</p>
        <p>“what is it”</p>
        <p>“if i fail and die could you sent my sisters away, since i am taking the test i should be the only one affected by it’s failure”</p>
        <p>there was silence for a bit before Luke responded</p>
        <p>“I can do that but during the period of the test you must protect both of them and if they die under your protection then it’s on you”</p>
        <p>after saying that his body started to turn illusionary and disappears</p>
        <p>“you have 5 minutes to get ready”</p>
        <p>after that he completely disappeared, i turn towards my sisters one looking at me with worry and the other with sadness</p>
        <p>“Nora i said that i would take care of you, be there for you, hence that’s what i am gonna do”</p>
        <p>while Austin was inside bullshiting to his sisters, outside the historic world things were less than peace full</p>
