        <p>Chapter 27: The Crisis</p>
        <p>i had actually known about both of my sister’s having hidden bloodline but they were not supposed to awaken it together</p>
        <p>unlike Clara whose bloodline though rare has methods to awaken it’s different for other’s as we have no idea what bloodline the person might awaken</p>
        <p>being a house of long history there might be several bloodline that we could awaken, some might even require certain condition to</p>
        <p>in the game Nora would awaken their families commander bloodline, where she would have special abilities that will cause fear on a battlefield, plus she would also awaken their special sword moves too</p>
        <p>but it wasn’t all that easy to awaken it as she had to get a special permission and an item from the historic world</p>
        <p>what are historic world’s you ask??</p>
        <p>some extremely powerful people might not be able to pass on their legacy hence they make a certain sub space which can be entered</p>
        <p>the person would have to pass the test designed and he would be able to earn that person’s power, there might be countless historical worlds spread around the world</p>
        <p>that is especially after the great war 1000s of year ago, if your lucky and stumble into it and gain the owners recognition you might go from a small chicken to a Phoenix</p>
        <p>for the Ezraeil empire they themself own a historic world, where a person can enter once</p>
        <p>‘in the game didn’t Nora’s mother almost sacrifice herself to gain recognition?’</p>
        <p>if my memory was right them in the game Nora’s mother had to sacrifice her power to to let Nora gain recognition as Nora was unable to move</p>
        <p>entering inside the room i came towards the Nora laying on the bed, she had changed a lot within these 3 years, her face which looked cute was slowly changing into a beauty</p>
        <p>i could see that she was in pain, her eyes were deeply closed and she kept wriggling on the bed, then i look towards Elda</p>
        <p>she had grown up a bit over the years too, losing a bit of her cubby cheeks, becoming to look more cute, right now she laying on the bed, her silver hair spread on the bed, looking just like a sleeping fairy</p>
        <p>according to my memories Elda had seemed to awaken a special bloodline relating to fairies itself, causing her to be extremely good at elemental control</p>
        <p>in the game the “protagonist” had to help her survive the bloodline while fighting in the historic world, it’s how you earn both Nora’s and Elda’s love but Elda only had awakened her bloodline at 15 year of age</p>
        <p>‘did my actions cause a change?’</p>
        <p>i couldn’t help but think that this was my fault but it’s no problem, mom will just have to sacrifice herself more</p>
        <p>but suddenly thinking of a pale faced and hurt Grace my heart contracts, my heart started to beat fast and pain seemed to cover me</p>
        <p>‘what’s going on?’</p>
        <p>‘why do i feel sad?’</p>
        <p>then i look towards both the girls laying on the bed who seemed to be in pain and then memories start to flow inside me</p>
        <p>the memories of a blonde hair elder sister who was acting tough on the outside but was gentle on the inside, her smug face and her childish expression seemed to flow before me</p>
        <p>suddenly a small silver haired girl enters my mind, the girl who always sticked to me, the one who had just desired warmth in her life, all of it just seemed flow through my mind</p>
        <p>‘Ha..Hahaa…Haaaa’</p>
        <p>i laugh, i laugh out loudly in my head, of course how could i be so stupid?, while i was earning thier affection they were earning mine too</p>
        <p>unknowingly i had come to accept this family of mine, they had come to earn a position in my heart, i close my eyes and takes a deep breath</p>
        <p>suddenly my hand was held, i open my eyes and looked towards my mother, she still had her gentle smile</p>
        <p>“don’t worry little Austy, your mother is here, nothing will happen to them”</p>
        <p>but the trembling of her eyes and the look of fear were not easy to be hidden from me, going closer i gave her a hug, right now i could only reach up to her breast, but still i conveyed my feeling to her</p>
        <p>she had reponded back by hugging me tighter, perhaps looking for a support, leaving the hug i looked towards my sleeping sisters and slowly determination starts to flow within me</p>
        <p>‘Nora, Elda no matter what happens i will protect you, no matter the cost’</p>
        <p>after i took my oath i suddenly felt my blood boil as if something that was hidden was awakening</p>
        <p>[Ding…..!]</p>
        <p>[ During the times of difficulty you still choose to accept your true self and choose to move according to your justice</p>
        <p>•The bloodline laying dormant within in you responds to your actions, they urge you to move forward and fulfill your desire</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>specail quest acitivated:</p>
        <p>>Bloodline: The Hidden Hero</p>
        <p>>Difficulty: SSS</p>
        <p>>Description: Hero’s aren’t born but they are made, you choosing to step up to save your family has been felt by your bloodline, so follow your will to the end</p>
        <p>•Help and save your sisters in awakening thier bloodline</p>
        <p>>Reward: The awakening of your hidden bloodline</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>reading through the information i was dumbfounded, i knew that helping my sister was difficult but difficulty SSS??</p>
        <p>do you guys think i am going to war or something?</p>
        <p>but the awakening of my bloodline is indeed something i require, over the three years i had tried countless ways to awaken it but with no luck, even the system’s awakening serums price was over the top</p>
        <p>even when Richard thought me cooking and left all he gave me was a badge which had the picture of a trident and the sea, the only thing i could understand from it was that it belong to the sea tribe</p>
        <p>all things considered, the awakening of my bloodline is indeed a huge plus but it seemed that it won’t be easy, i take a look into my systems shop function</p>
        <p>‘looks like i need to start spending a lot of points’</p>
        <p>it was at this time time 3 girls who i had left at my room arrived, entering the room they quicky found about the situation</p>
        <p>knowing what was happening they quickly moved to comfort me, they themselves had a good impression of my sisters as they don’t put up any arrogant faces</p>
        <p>“mom why don’t we use the teleportation room to travel to the palace, the people there might know more about the bloodline awakening”</p>
        <p>“i already contacted your uncle,they are preaping the transportation, we will leave in 5 minutes”</p>
        <p>after that we had moved my sister to a stretcher like bed and was brought to the teleportation room, i let the girls stay back</p>
        <p>standing in the teleportation circle after a few seconds it started to lit up, so i had to close my eyes, when i opened them again we were in a much larger room</p>
        <p>there were several mages standing around us as we had landed, several of the people who were on stand by quicky started to move, they started to checking upon Nora and Elda</p>
