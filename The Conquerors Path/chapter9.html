        <p>Chapter 9: Letting It All Out</p>
        <p>Four days has passed since the last day i had lunch with my little sister, during that time i continued to play with her.</p>
        <p>Due to my constant efforts, i have managed to rise her affection towards me quite a lot</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Name: Elda Lionheart</p>
        <p>Age: 6</p>
        <p>Talent:9/10</p>
        <p>Title: None</p>
        <p>power: Null</p>
        <p>Love: 89%(sibling love)</p>
        <p>Description: wants to get close to her big brother but dosent know how.Looks a bit down on you due to your wimpy side.</p>
        <p>>desires to play with her big brother</p>
        <p>Difficulty:B+(she is a child if you play your cards right, she’s yours)</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>During this time a rumor started to spread that i had began to change from my wimpy side, after it spread my mother had visited me and i gave her an Oscar winning performance</p>
        <p>Teary eyed and indignant i screamed</p>
        <p>“Mother don’t worry about me i am worried more about you, you haven’t slept in a long time and i know that stress is piling on you”</p>
        <p>“you don’t have to worry about me mother, i have decided to change for the better, i don’t want to burden you”</p>
        <p>“i will do my best so that i can help you”</p>
        <p>i tried my best to play the character of an innocent boy who had began to change and immaturely he dreams of helping his mother</p>
        <p>I must have done well, because the result i got was a teary eyed mother who hugged me like i am the most precious thing in the world.</p>
        <p>right now i am sitting in the library reading through different books while planning on how to conquer my big sister</p>
        <p>unlike Elda, i can’t just spoon feed her and expect her to start gloating all over me, if she lets me spoon feed her that is</p>
        <p>She already has a mild dislike for me, so erasing that and starting anew is not easy</p>
        <p>sighing and rubbing my head i start to drink the tea Mia had brought me,</p>
        <p>‘sigh if only i could have some support, well she’s a kid after all, she might throw tantrums’</p>
        <p>It was only then i realised something, ‘ of courese she’s a kid!!’</p>
        <p>right now i was planning on how i can conquer the mature Nora not the kid Nora</p>
        <p>‘i really am acting like an idiot’</p>
        <p>In the game the story only officialy starts in the school arc where she was 20 years old</p>
        <p>why is she 20 and still in school you ask??</p>
        <p>That’s because unlike the normal schools the school she attends is attended by the nobles from around the whole world and the graduating age is 24 years.</p>
        <p>The Babylon imperial school created by all the races and located in the Babylon city, being the most popular and greatest city in the world</p>
        <p>it is a floating city located between silvyia and silvie realm, a city compromising of the worlds greatest school and head offices of many important establishments.</p>
        <p>the school normal starts for 14 year old kids and lasts for 9 years.</p>
        <p>leaving aside all that,i think i might have an idea for making that big sister of mine fall</p>
        <p>“young master, eldest miss Nora requests your precense”</p>
        <p>speak of the devil and the devil shall come smirking i asked Mia to lead the way</p>
        <p>walking towards my elder sister’s location i started revising some my earlier made plans</p>
        <p>‘Looks like i need to push things up a bit’</p>
        <p>musing to myself i was led to the area my sister was located, entering the room i was greeted with the sight of my sister enjoying her tea while the sunlight surrounding her made her looks mystifying.</p>
        <p>while i entered she looked towards me, the normal Austin might have flinched and looked away but i looked directly into her eyes and confidently strolled into the room</p>
        <p>my demeanor suprised her a bit, she had heard about the things i had done these few days and wanted to see for her self if i had changed</p>
        <p>‘Looks like the rumors are true after all’</p>
        <p>while my big sis was musing to herself i sat next to her and started drinking my tea, for a moment a strange silence lingered between us, as the tension had started to make the maids uncomfortable my sister made her move</p>
        <p>“hows you body?, are you alright now?”</p>
        <p>“its fine i have mostly recovered and i am doing well now”</p>
        <p>“i see that’s good”</p>
        <p>again silence prevailed over us as the tension was about to rise again, i suggested</p>
        <p>“why don’t we play some chess?”</p>
        <p>my suggestion suprised her but after thinking about it she nodded</p>
        <p>“sure, i have some time before my next class”</p>
        <p>after some time the maids had arranged everything and we had began our game.</p>
        <p>Not to brag but as a straight A student and a rank holder in universities i am quite good at chess</p>
        <p>as our game began, i started my plan</p>
        <p>“Big sis, i know that you think that i am responsible for father’s death and that you dislike me for it”</p>
        <p>I made the first move along with my words and she flinched when she heard my words and her piece almost fell</p>
        <p>“You don’t have to deny it, it’s true but that doesn’t mean you have the right to accuse me of anything, you weren’t there, you didn’t see nor did you experience what i did and don’t worry i don’t blame you”</p>
        <p>THUD</p>
        <p>I placed my next move</p>
        <p>“After father’s death i ran away and hid like a cowrd and i wasn’t there to support you, it’s my fault. I realised that late but from now on i will change”</p>
        <p>THUD</p>
        <p>she made her move, her expression crumbling</p>
        <p>“Big sister i know father’s death hit you very badly, i know you hid the pain behind that external appearance of yours”</p>
        <p>THUD</p>
        <p>I made my move, my sister trying best to maintain her expression</p>
        <p>“so let me in Sis, i promise you to stand together with you, to be your support, you can cry sis, you can be yourself when you are with me”</p>
        <p>THUD</p>
        <p>she made a move, this time her hands trembling</p>
        <p>“i am the younger brother and i know that you think its your responsibility to stay strong but let it go for now, i want to see my real sis, the one who despite being pained still hides it”</p>
        <p>THUD</p>
        <p>I made my move, my sister’s body trembling</p>
        <p>“Let it all out sis, don’t hide it everyone is there with you, we all love, i love you”</p>
        <p>THUD</p>
        <p>she made her move</p>
        <p>I place the final piece</p>
        <p>“chekmate”</p>
        <p>placing the final piece, i stood up and walked towards my seated sister who now had tears flowing down her eyes, i walked close to her and pulled her into my embrace</p>
        <p>though i am shorter than her, due to her being seated, when i hugged her, her face came upon my chest and immediately like a broken dam tears flowed.</p>
        <p>she clutched my shirt and started brawling out in an intense cry, her body shivered and she let out all the greveinces she faced all this while</p>
        <p>Her pain</p>
        <p>Her suffering</p>
        <p>Her anger</p>
        <p>Her unwillingness</p>
        <p>everything was let out today in her tears</p>
        <p>i stood supporting her waiting for her to finish when a notification hit me</p>
        <p>+30,000 affection</p>
