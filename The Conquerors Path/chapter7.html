        <p>Chapter 7: Information(2)</p>
        <p>So yeah there something I have to tell you guys</p>
        <p>I have changed the names of the realms</p>
        <p>I changed human realm to Silviya realm and Demon realm To Silvie realm</p>
        <p>That’s all!!</p>
        <p>****************************************************************************************************</p>
        <p>Anyway enough about dragon’s, the next species is the beastmens</p>
        <p>They are divided into diffrent tribes and spread across a single empire,among them the four</p>
        <p>main clans are:</p>
        <p>The Lion Tribe</p>
        <p>The Tiger Tribe</p>
        <p>The Wolf Tribe</p>
        <p>The Cat Tribe</p>
        <p>each tribe has other clans below them and is ruled by the main clan like a council, there is no single king, surprisingly such a system really works well for them</p>
        <p>unlike the elves the beastmens are more inclined towards close combact than magic, though they use magic in combat</p>
        <p>each clan has its own specialty, such as the cat tribe being great assassins, the tiger tribe being great treasure hunters.</p>
        <p>All the clans had come together to create an exotic world of their own which is a great tourist spot in this world.</p>
        <p>After that we have the dwarves, they actually dont have their own country but a city, known to be impenetrable to all.</p>
        <p>Due to their low birth rate the dwarves have a lesser populations, so they came together to create the dwarven city.</p>
        <p>built with high metal walls and technology, the city is literally impenetrable. Another thing about the dwarves is that they own about 56% of the worlds weapon production.</p>
        <p>A scary number to say the truth as they only Iive for smithing and drinking, it is said that the dwarves have more money than they can spend.</p>
        <p>After them comes the humans unlike the other races the humans are not well knit nor do they have any speciality.</p>
        <p>That was what the other races had thought but the humans took their weakness as strength and expaned their ways.</p>
        <p>we started producing magical weapons and as a group of extraordinary thinking we started learing the specialty of others and started to excel in them.</p>
        <p>humans also has their own share of extraordinary experts and powers</p>
        <p>currently there are 2 human empire and other human countries surrounding it, both the empire’s are equal in strength.</p>
        <p>The empire i am currently in is the Ezraeil Empire currently ruled by Claus Ezraeil the 8th, he took control of the empire 15 years ago.</p>
        <p>The other is the twilight empire, ruled by Maxwell twilight the 8th.</p>
        <p>surrounding them are other countries who strength canot be scoffed at, they themself have specialities and strenghts.</p>
        <p>like the country of Angria which completly focuses on magic, it is said that even the commoners their knows basic magic</p>
        <p>The country of Avalon focues in kinghts and they are basically close combact oriented</p>
        <p>so these are the basic in the human “realm”, why realm you ask?,</p>
        <p>This is beacuse the Silvie realm and the Silviya realm are not exactly on the same plane</p>
        <p>The realm containing humans,elves,beastmens and dwarves was made by the goddess Silviya and the demon realm by the godess silvie</p>
        <p>to travel between each realm one needs to use a transport gate and as for the demon realm??</p>
        <p>they have countless different types of demons, where there exist only 2 empire ruling them all, The Efeth and The Olane empire.</p>
        <p>The Efeth empire is ruled by the Efeth demons and the Olane empire is ruled by the Olane demons</p>
        <p>Other than this there is another race created by both the godesses, the aquatic species that live within the sea.</p>
        <p>A great aquatic empire ruled by both the mermaid and whale tribes.</p>
        <p>unlike what people would expect there is no large rate war or dislike between the races, infact they live in harmony, where different races live with each other</p>
        <p>well that is after what took place thousands of year ago, for some reason there was a war between the goddess Sylvia and Sylvie</p>
        <p>The war escalated to such degree that millions died and blood had made the world red, but no one actually knew why there was a war between the godesses</p>
        <p>well…..except for me who had played the game, there was a hidden quest to be completed and i had found the reason</p>
        <p>its nothing great, it was a small disagreement between the goddess, the godess Silvie wanted to live and interact with her creations forming a harmony</p>
        <p>but Godess silviya just wanted let her creations as they are, with no interactions</p>
        <p>so…..yup a great war occured beacuse of that, you can imagine my surprise when i found about it.</p>
        <p>opening my eyes and rubbing my sore body i decided to take a walk</p>
        <p>“oh yeah before that, hey system show me all the application you can provide me”</p>
        <p>[yes, host]</p>
        <p>[</p>

        <p>]</p>
        <p>looking at the given choices a few doubts arose in my mind.</p>
        <p>“hey system what’s information?”</p>
        <p>[Its as the name implies, you can check into the information and buy certain information at a certain price]</p>
        <p>[ And before you ask the “price” is referred to counterattack points which you earn while conquering each capture targets or doing something determinal to the main protagonist]</p>
        <p>while listening to the systems explanation my expression becomes weider and weider, so basically i have to touble the main protagonist.</p>
        <p>‘Damn that God is quite vengful’ ,throwing my thoughts away i click status, suddenly a blue screen appears in front of me</p>
