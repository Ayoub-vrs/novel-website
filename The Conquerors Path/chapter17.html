        <p>Chapter 17: Going Forward</p>
        <p>The next moring after my meet up and cooking lessons with Richard i left towards the shop of my current master, i am really exited about what she’s goin to teach me today</p>
        <p>reaching the shop i saw that it was closed, just i was about to knock i felt a sudden dizzy feeling and the next moment i know i am inside the shop seated across my master</p>
        <p>to think she can just pull me into the shop, is this the power of an imperial, this just makes me more exited to learn about the supernatural</p>
        <p>Eleanor looked towards her current disciple who was looking at her with excitement and eagerness</p>
        <p>‘he looks just as exited as me when i stated’</p>
        <p>“do you want to eat anything?”</p>
        <p>“no need i ate and came”</p>
        <p>“then lets start, what do you know about the origin way”</p>
        <p>after that i explained to her the basic idea i know and she nodded to it</p>
        <p>“umm, thats pretty much it, looks like you study well”</p>
        <p>i “blushed” to her words as if happy and embarrassed about it</p>
        <p>“by the way do you currently feel any connection with the atmosphere?”</p>
        <p>“ohh, you mean the little particles floating around?”</p>
        <p>“so you can feel it”</p>
        <p>after that Eleanor sighed and looked at me like a rare specimen</p>
        <p>“Austin do you know that you currently have a plate its tier 3 and rank 10”</p>
        <p>“what !”</p>
        <p>i shouted in suprise, real this time</p>
        <p>‘so wait i am tier 3!!, no wait whats rank 10 plate?’</p>
        <p>“master is there a rank for plates?”</p>
        <p>“ohh, i forgot they didn’t teach you about it yet”</p>
        <p>“The plates formed in your body also has ranks, it determines how much forward you can go in your path”</p>
        <p>“its noramlly from Rank 1 to Rank 10, with Rank 1 being the lowest and Rank 10 being the highest, the Rank 7 and above plates are termed as genuises”</p>
        <p>‘damn, i didn’t know about this!, looks like everything can’t be found in the library’</p>
        <p>“master does that mean i am strong”</p>
        <p>i reacted with “excitement”</p>
        <p>“no its the opposite your body is in danger, your curent body is like a glass overflowing with water but the glass holding it isn’t strong”</p>
        <p>“if it goes like this, your body wont be able to handle it and explode”</p>
        <p>silence….</p>
        <p>‘damn, i didn’t know that!!, system you didn’t tell me anything about it!!’</p>
        <p>[System, duties is only to support not to warn and protect the host]</p>
        <p>‘Your heartless!, plus whats wrong with this women, is this something you say directly to an 8 year old boys face?, if it was any other kid he would be peeing his pants’</p>
        <p>What Austin didnt know was that it wasn’t much of a problem and it was easy to settle to but Eleanor wanted to see how he would react to death and seeing him so compsed impressed and made her curious</p>
        <p>“aren’t you afraid of death?”</p>
        <p>‘afraid?, of course i am!!, who wouldn’t its just that my poker face is good, wait this could be an opportunity to score some points’</p>
        <p>putting on my serious face i directly looked into her eyes</p>
        <p>“of course i am, but the fear of losing my family is more to painful to me than fear of death’</p>
        <p>“my father gave his life to protect mine he only had one wish that was for me to protect my family and i plan to do that, so no matter what comes i will survive it”</p>
        <p>in the end my voice raised to high pitch for dramatic effect</p>
        <p>‘oph….thank you wuxia novels for your cliche lines’</p>
        <p>looking at my master i saw a deeply surprised face on hers contradicting to her normal graceful self, suddenly i felt a pull on me and the next moment i was in her embrace, an unique orchid smell entered my nose</p>
        <p>‘oh..man these pillows are huge maybe even than my mother’</p>
        <p>meanwhile Eleanor</p>
        <p>‘ahh, what a pitiful child dont worry master would protect you and make sure your strong, such a pitiful child master is there for you’</p>
        <p>thinking of it she ruffled the boys hair who was looking at her with absolute trust and admiration</p>
        <p>‘ahh..if you look at tracher like that, then i cant help but pamper you’</p>
        <p>+3000 affection</p>
        <p>‘wow, looks like my words hit her pretty hard’</p>
        <p>then suddenly i again felt the same pull and when i opened my eyes i was in a forest near a cliff, Eleanor then puts me down</p>
        <p>“from now we are going to get your body accustomed to your power, so your first task is to run 5km here then do 20 pushups, squats and situps”</p>
        <p>“after your warmup your task will be to climb the mountain after that, when you reach the top we can start the real training”</p>
        <p>looking at the tall clif as if touching the sky, my feet suddenly felt unsteady, putting on my puppy eyes i looked towards her but all she gave me back was a look of disappointment seeing that i clutched my teeth</p>
        <p>“I will do it but after that will teacher show me her face?”</p>
        <p>After my question she hesitated a bit but then later she nodded, seeing that I took action</p>
        <p>the warmups even though hard was accomplish able but when it came to the cliff, i climbed scraped my knee, my hands turned red,my nails peeled almost of and i almost fell to my death but master saved me at each turn</p>
        <p>like this is it was only 2 months later that i reached the top, standing above it and seeing the rising sun i gave it out a huge scream of accomplishment, at that time the thought that cane to me was</p>
        <p>Behind me stood my master proud without a veil covering her face, her black hair swayed in the wind, her her looked beautiful creating a beautiful picture at first her beauty moved but then later a more important thought came to me</p>
        <p>‘when i am strong enough, i must destroy this cliff’</p>
        <p>and like that a few years later this huge cliff disappeared from this world, no one knows how</p>
