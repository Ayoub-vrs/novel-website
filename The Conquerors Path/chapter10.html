        <p>Chapter 10: Changes</p>
        <p>Holy moly +30,000 i knew that she would react instantly but i didnt expect such an intense one, but thinking about it’s quiet normal</p>
        <p>she lived her life suppressing her pain and playing out the character of a strong girl, without anybody to openly talk about, her pain doubled</p>
        <p>plus the guilt of using her smaller brother to get rid of her pain must have hurt her a lot, and my forgiveness must have hit her hard</p>
        <p>she went on crying for about the next 5 minutes, when she had finished we stayed in the same position for about 10 minutes, i was the one who first talked</p>
        <p>“are you okay”</p>
        <p>There was no reponse but i had felt a small nod on my chest, after that silence prevailed, i looked down towards my sister and what i saw suprised me</p>
        <p>she was holding her head down, her eyes closed and her whole face red in embarrassment like a tomato, her lips pursed she looked so adorable that i wanted to give her a bite</p>
        <p>feeling my gaze she looked up towards me, her eyes hazy, her venerable look caused my heartbeat to fasten, i started feeling a little fuzzy</p>
        <p>feeling a bit mischievous, i leaned forward and gave a kiss on her forhead, going towards her ears i whispered</p>
        <p>“you look so cute right now sis”</p>
        <p>And before i could say anything she pushed me away and ran away from me, i turned around to the door only to see a couple of suprised maids not knowing why their eldest miss was running.</p>
        <p>laughing i stood up and started walking, to my eldest sisters room that is…</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Nora’s pov:</p>
        <p>i ran and ran, i kept running away from my little brother, without even bothering about the suprised gazes from the maids i ran to my room</p>
        <p>Give orders that no one can enter my room, i ran inside and jumped to my bed</p>
        <p>‘arghhhh, what did you do Nora, why did you cry in front of your little brother, he’s going to think your a crybaby!!”</p>
        <p>laying on my bed i look towards my ceiling taking deep breathes i tried to control my emotion but then I touched my forehead and my little brother’s words enter my mind</p>
        <p>‘You look so cute right now sis’</p>
        <p>Remembering those words my face starts to Heat up how can he say such words!!</p>
        <p>i close my eyes and started to remember what had really happened now, i had heard rumors that my brother had started to change recently</p>
        <p>curious about it i had called him to have a tea with me, i had expected him to act like usual all scared and fearful of his big sister</p>
        <p>but to my suprise he didn’t display any of it, unusual of him, he displayed at most confidence in himself, for a moment i thought he was someone else</p>
        <p>but then looking at his silver hair and purple eyes just like father’s , i threw that notion away. whenever i see him father’s image always comes to my mind</p>
        <p>i had always bullied him for father’s death, i felt that if it weren’t for him then father would be alive, that he would come home pat my head and play with me like always</p>
        <p>but i knew that was a dream and that i was just using my brother to went my pain and frustration, in all honesty i wanted to go upto him and apologize for everything and say that i was sorry</p>
        <p>but i couldn’t do it, i had thought that today would be the same as always but unexpectedly he had asked for a game of chess, thinking nothing of it i agreed</p>
        <p>but i didn’t think that he would use the game to bring out the fears and pain that i hid, each word he said had pulled my heart strings and before i knew it i was crying in his embrace.</p>
        <p>while i was reeling in my emotions i heard a knock on my door and then a voice from whom i ran away was heard</p>
        <p>“big sister can i come in”</p>
        <p>silence…..</p>
        <p>“big sister, could you open the door”</p>
        <p>silence…..</p>
        <p>‘why did he come here!!, did he come here to make fun of me’</p>
        <p>while i was thinking i walked towards the door hesitating wether i should open it or not, i really didn’t know how to face him</p>
        <p>“sigh…big sis if you are angry at me, then i am sorry”</p>
        <p>“whatever i said back then was from my heart, i don’t want you to be in pain and loneliness”</p>
        <p>i bit my lips hearing his words, my heart felt happiness and sourness at once</p>
        <p>“You don’t have to be embarrassed for crying sis, you are my idol, i look upto you”</p>
        <p>“You crying does not change that, nor what you do in the future, you will always be my great big sister”</p>
        <p>“i will wait tommorrow in the same room for you, let’s play chess again or are you scared that you will loose to me?”</p>
        <p>silence…</p>
        <p>“i will wait for you as we are a family”</p>
        <p>i heard the sound of his footsteps leaving the door of my room while i slide and sat by getting the support of the door</p>
        <p>a tear fell down my face this time not of sadness but of happiness</p>
        <p>“Austin, that idot i will get him tomorrow”</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Austin pov:</p>
        <p>i hum merrily while i head towards my room, my plan had gone better than i thought, looks like i can start the other plans</p>
        <p>[Ding…]</p>
        <p>[The starting pack gift has been activated, do you want to open?]</p>
        <p>“a starting pack gift?, why am i only getting it now?”</p>
        <p>[Due to a certain connection problem it had only arrived now]</p>
        <p>raising an eyebrow to that answer,i decided to open it once i get to my room, while i reached there i saw a six year old silver haired girl standing there pouting.</p>
        <p>i was suprised at first but after a bit of thinking i understood her reason, when i got close she jumped into my embrace and started beating my chest</p>
        <p>“booo, big brother you did not come to play today, i waited a lot and you didn’t come”</p>
        <p>looking at me with her pouting face ahe expressed her indignation, smiling i poked her cheeks</p>
        <p>“i am sorry Elda, i had a meeting with big sis and i was held up there”</p>
        <p>After a bit of pampering her, she finally started to smile, to make it upto her i suggested something</p>
        <p>“why dont you come and sleep with your brother today”</p>
        <p>my suggestion suprised her and she started to blush and look away</p>
        <p>“i-if big brother wants then i have no problem”</p>
        <p>saying that she ran away, shaking my head i enter my room.</p>
