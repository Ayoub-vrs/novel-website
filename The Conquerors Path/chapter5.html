        <p>Chapter 5: Family</p>
        <p>Nora Lionheart being one of the important capture targets she was blessed with beauty, strength and background.</p>
        <p>She was among one of the girls i had conquered, a person who displays a strong front like she cares about nothing but has a warm hidden heart within her</p>
        <p>That person in now standing in front of me, it really is a surreal experience, i always wondered why people would buy figurines of thier interest, now i can understand why, it really is exiting to have a figure of your imagination in front of you</p>
        <p>right now in front if me stood a girl of 10 year, blonde hair that fell to her shoulders, green eyes just like her mother, a round and beautiful face which looked cute, no doubt she would swoon the hearts of countless men in the future when she grows up.</p>
        <p>Beside her stood a timid girl of six, a short blob of silver hair, a pair of large green eyes blinking with innocence looking directly into mine.</p>
        <p>Elda Lionheart inheriting my fathers hair and mother eyes, she is one of the important pieces in making Nora fall in love with you</p>
        <p>in the game we have to save Elda heroically while winning Nora’s heart, after that we are given a choice of taking Elda has you younger sister or….lover along with Nora</p>
        <p>You can take Elda has your lover if you are capable of keeping it a secret from her big sister, or if you have a certain taste for well….you know loli’s</p>
        <p>Game aside right now i am being stared upon by my sister.</p>
        <p>“humph, just as i thought you really are a weakling, just fainting after breakfast”</p>
        <p>my sister said staring at me like a weakling, staring at her like a scared kid i dive deeper into my mothers breast “fearfully”</p>
        <p>‘girl wait for me to conquer you after that i will be whooping your ass later, but damn so soft’</p>
        <p>seeing her son hug her tighter, Grace didnt think much of it, who would think that an 8 year old will be having the soul of a 22 year old man?</p>
        <p>sighing Grace looked towards her eldest daughter who had began to bully her younger brother after her husbands demise</p>
        <p>Thinking of her husband a pang of pain hits heart, bringing herself back together she looks towards her daughter</p>
        <p>“Nora dont bully your brother, you know he as been through a lot,”</p>
        <p>hearing her mother reproach her she clicked her tongue and looked away.</p>
        <p>And while i was enjoying this smooth land of pillows a notification hit me</p>
        <p>[Ding….!]</p>
        <p>[capture targets detected, does host want to activate read function]</p>
        <p>‘read function, what’s that?’</p>
        <p>[it lets the host read certain information about a target the host looks at]</p>
        <p>‘oh, then activate it’ , saying so i looked towards my so called big sister and a row of information appears</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Name: Nora Lionheart</p>
        <p>Age: 10</p>
        <p>Talent:10/10</p>
        <p>Titles: None</p>
        <p>Love: 50%(sibling love)</p>
        <p>Description: Even though you are her brother she has a small dislike for you born from her father’s death and your wimpy attitude infuriate’s her</p>
        <p>Difficulty:AA+ (you are her brother, the difficulty of making her love you as a man is extremely difficult )</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>Reading this i got a basic idea of how she thinks of me and I get that she thinks i am partly responsible for that incident</p>
        <p>it Seems that Austin’s father had died a year ago protecting him.</p>
        <p>His father was ambushed outside their territory by a group of assassins while travelling with Austin, it was said that maybe he could have lived if not for Austin.</p>
        <p>so Nora always had a grudge at him for it, looks like the kid became like this beacuse if his low esteem</p>
        <p>Then i looked towards my little sister</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Name: Elda Lionheart</p>
        <p>Age: 6</p>
        <p>Talent:9/10</p>
        <p>Title: None</p>
        <p>Love: 66%(sibling love)</p>
        <p>Description: wants to get close to her big brother but dosen’t know how.Looks a bit down on you due to your wimpy side.</p>
        <p>>desires to play with her big brother</p>
        <p>Difficulty:B+(she is a child if you play your cards right, she’s yours)</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>‘umm, its better than i thought, i might have a basic idea on how to deal with her’</p>
        <p>Lastly i look towards my mother</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Name:Grace Lionheart</p>
        <p>Age: 33</p>
        <p>Talent: 9/10</p>
        <p>Title: princess of the battlefield, The Red Rose</p>
        <p>Love 100%(a mother’s love is always max)</p>
        <p>Description:Love you no matter what.</p>
        <p>>currently in mild depression and sleep loss</p>
        <p>>Her heart pains because of her broken family</p>
        <p>Difficulty: S (come on she’s your mother, how hard do you think it is you make her see you as a man)</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>seeing this my eyes widen from suprise, it seems that i can even conquer my mother if i want, this opens a whole new area of experimentation.</p>
        <p>After checking upon me, my family choose to leave me to rest, which i asked for and my little sister approched me before everyone left</p>
        <p>pulling my shirt she said</p>
        <p>“big brother, i hope you get well soon”</p>
        <p>hearing her words i smiled and rubbed my hands on her head for a pat to her suprise</p>
        <p>“Dont worry when big brother gets better, i will play with you a lot”</p>
        <p>suprised from my sudden act of intimacy which was out of my chaarcter she was first suprised but after that she smiled shyly and ran away</p>
        <p>shaking my head in amusement, i lay on my bed</p>
        <p>A lot happened today and truthfully i haven’t accepted it all completely, even if my soul is of an adult my current body if of a child</p>
        <p>it can’t handle all this stress</p>
        <p>‘Whatever happens from now i will deal with it then’</p>
        <p>saying so i fall into blissful sleep.</p>
