        <p>Chapter 40: Trouble Still Finds A Way</p>
        <p>well if you want me to go more into the truth, it seemed that during the creation of this world by both the goddesses Sylvia and Silvie a small part of both their power fell from them into the world</p>
        <p>one of it grew into a tree while the other into a jade, as you can guess the tree was once made into a bow and the jade to a harp</p>
        <p>even though the bow was only used by the hunters at that time to hunt some food, my ancestor choose it as his future path and he ended up using the same bow made out of one of the godesses power</p>
        <p>while his lover coincidentally happened to play the harp as her weapon, in normal cases no one should have been able to draw out even a bit of their powers but there is always exceptions</p>
        <p>during the war 1000s of years ago my ancestor had to watch his most beloved women die due to the war he then in anger and despair sacrificed his soul and did somthing unbelievable</p>
        <p>people might be surprised when they now how much power a human could bring out of him in times of despair</p>
        <p>my ancestor combined both the bow and the harp and fired a single arrow to destroy the world, that single arrows power was greater than both the goddesses combined!!</p>
        <p>it had almost tore the world apart!!</p>
        <p>but looking at the current harp it wont be able to produce that same power, still it’s more powerful than any other weapons out there</p>
        <p>And that’s the problem, I am 100% sure that I have caught the eye of several powerful figures, it’s no doubt that a weapon like this will not just be left for waste</p>
        <p>‘Nothing I can do about it now’</p>
        <p>Throwing the problems at the back of my head I focused on the current issue</p>
        <p>Looking at the harp I gave it a mental command and i saw the 2 edges of the harp quickly expanding and the several purple stings joined together making a single one</p>
        <p>the harp changed into a very beautiful bow but suddenly i felt a small headache and the Sphinx disappeared</p>
        <p>looks like my current mana was not enough to keep it active for a long time, it was at this time that i noticed an anomaly</p>
        <p>i was hurt and just woke up then why aren’t there any people coming to see me, there are also no maid around me too, soon my expression hardened</p>
        <p>‘somethings wrong!’</p>
        <p>as soon as i though that the space in front of me twisted and a women came in front of my bed</p>
        <p>red haired that fell down to her ass, an extremely sexy body and burning red eyes with slits, she had a beautiful face with an arched eyebrow and a small black dot near her right eye</p>
        <p>that small dot instead of looking bad gave her a different seductive charm</p>
        <p>her whole body carried absolute confidence,pride and arrogance that was naturally displayed, all this wasn’t developed but something she was naturally born with</p>

        <p>Name: Vena Dragoneer</p>
        <p>Sex: Female</p>
        <p>Age: 400</p>
        <p>species: Dragon</p>
        <p>Talent: 9/10</p>
        <p>Power: Draganoid level 3</p>
        <p>Title: The Dragon Empress, magical queen, the never ending…etc</p>
        <p>Love : 0%…..40%…..-60%….1%$^# (love level unidentifiable)</p>
        <p>Description: ever since she had her dragon bloodline activated she anyways felt that there was something she was missing</p>
        <p>>she felt that somthing was preventing her from completely falling in love with her husband</p>
        <p>>today she came to completely get rid of that feeling</p>
        <p>Difficulty: first you survive this, then we can talk about cucking the dragon Emperor</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>‘fuck!, i am dead’</p>
        <p>looking at the women in front of me i felt my body go cold, i knew that my ancestor had managed to seduce a dragon but who would have thought that the dragon’s descendant would be the dragon Empress!!</p>
        <p>seeing the women who clearly came here to kill me, my brain quickly started to calculate a way out, i started to quickly gather the information i can</p>
        <p>looking at the women i could see that unlike the Empress Lora the feeling being provided by her bloodline has not taken complete control of her, she seemed to be fighting it</p>
        <p>also the fact that up and till these 11 years she hasn’t found to kill me means that the changes only happened after i awakened my bloodline</p>
        <p>my brain started working over time to find a way out as i didn’t want to end up in hell, then i saw the flashing of complicated emotions in the women and a plan slowly formed in my mind</p>
        <p>i sighed and put on a deadpan expression</p>
        <p>“so you came to kill me huh….”</p>
        <p>as i spoke my words i could see her emotions going more out of control</p>
        <p>‘i was right!’</p>
        <p>it seems that Vena didn’t really want to kill me, dragons are beings who believe in actions if someone didn’t disrespect them, then they wont do anything</p>
        <p>due to their extreme strength, pride and arrogance they see other species as something to protect, like when adults look at children’s, so unless you tick them off, they are mostly mild</p>
        <p>she knew that her problem was due to her bloodline and i just ended up with a bloodline controlling her,which was not really my fault but her ancestors</p>
        <p>she can’t just kill me for that can she?, but she as to do it no matter the cost</p>
        <p>after i spoke Vena responded</p>
        <p>“child i do not know you name, i know that what’s happening right now is not your problem”</p>
        <p>“but still i have to get rid of you, do you have anything to say?”</p>
        <p>the more i heard Vena speak the more my plans seemed plausible, suppressing my excitement i spoke</p>
        <p>“i also do not know who you are but i know that you must be related to my bloodline”</p>
        <p>“you don’t have to kill me to get rid of the feeling you have right now i can do it myself”</p>
        <p>hearing my words Vena went into deep thought naturally she wasn’t an idiot to trust my words</p>
        <p>seeing that she was in deep thought i quickly pulled out my main trick, raising my hand and placing it on my chest i made a vow</p>
        <p>“i vow in the name of the creator goddess Sylvia that i have a way to solve the issue and i will do it for you”</p>
        <p>hearing my vow Vena became a bit suprised but then she nodded, swearing on the goddess Sylvia was a huge promise if you broke it your soul would be destroyed completely</p>
        <p>seeing that Vena agreed i let out a sigh, looking at me she asked</p>
        <p>“what do i have to do?”</p>
        <p>“nothing much your problem is due to a contract kept on your bloodline i just have to touch your forehead and remove it from you”</p>
        <p>hearing my reply she nodded and came close to me, the moment she came close to me a heavy suffocating feeling came upon me but that went away quickly</p>
        <p>seeing that i am fine even under her pressure Vena was surprised, no human should be able to move freely within a dragons domain but she put the matter back at her mind and focused on the current issue</p>
        <p>when Vena had reached close to me i lifted my hand and placed it in her forehead, i could feel the contract on her bloodline now being suppressed by Vena</p>
        <p>as for if i could remove it of course i can but why should i ?</p>
        <p>Slowly I activated my bloodline and send a small bit of my mana into it, the suppressed contract suddenly gained more strength and started fighting against Vena</p>
        <p>As soon I had done it I activated my band and disappeared at the same time the hand waved by Vena to kill me missed, sitting on my bed I saw Vena falling to her knees trying To fight it to no wail</p>
        <p>Seeing a dragon on her knees in front of me felt a bit good and knowing that she is the wife of one of the strongest man in the world further bloated my ego</p>
        <p>After rolling on the floor a bit she finally stopped and stood up, the eyes which were previously confused was now clear</p>
