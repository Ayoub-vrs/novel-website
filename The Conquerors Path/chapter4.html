        <p>Chapter 4: My New Identity</p>
        <p>Austin Lionheart a name that every player who has played Arizinons sense will know.</p>
        <p>A person for who even i felt pity for in the game.</p>
        <p>he was the younger brother of one of the capture targets.He was a wimp and crybaby who admired the protagonist and called him “big brother”.</p>
        <p>Having looks that made even the protagonist jealous and someone who hid and behaved like a girl.</p>
        <p>he was said to have talents in combat but due to suffering a trauma at an young age he became afraid of fights</p>
        <p>well if that was all then it was no problem but he was then used by the game producers as a sacrifice to boost the protagonist.</p>
        <p>it was revealed that the simp like kid was having an affair with his uncles wife, that is the azraeil empires empress.</p>
        <p>Also the empress was so excessively attached to him that she burned herself along with him so that they could be together in death!!</p>
        <p>plus it was later discovered that the empress had forced upon him and had blackmailed to keep him for herself while hiding it under everyones eyes</p>
        <p>Remembering the scene of how Austin was screaming in despair on how he was being burned with the empress, makes my body go cold.</p>
        <p>taking a deep breath to control my body, i take a walk towards the mirror placed in my room and takes a look</p>
        <p>i gazed upon a eight year old boy with silver hair, deep and penetrating purple eyes, cubby cheeks along with a cute nose giving a very cute appearance.</p>
        <p>yup its him alright, although young i could still tell the characteristic of his handsome face of the future.</p>
        <p>‘th-then she must be real too,s-so arent i already dead?!’</p>
        <p>‘wait wait take deep breath, the other things are only going to take place so the attraction of the empress must have not happened till now’</p>
        <p>‘yeah that’s right, i don’t have to get afraid i still have time’</p>
        <p>forcefully stopping my panic,i slowly began to calm down.</p>
        <p>[host is you inner monologue over?]</p>
        <p>“yeah what’s up”</p>
        <p>[its just that i have yet to transfer you current bodies memories to you, so could you preapre yourself]</p>
        <p>“memories?’</p>
        <p>its only then did i realize that i didn’t have any of the past memories of this body</p>
        <p>“sure tell me what do i have to do”</p>
        <p>[nothing much host just has to lay down on the bed while i transfer the memories to you, there might be a slight headache, that’s all]</p>
        <p>giving a nod i walk towards my bed and lay down</p>
        <p>[starting procedure in 3..2..1]</p>
        <p>suddenly a mild pain comes to my mind and i start to see some images, like a movie they pass through my mind, i closed my eyes and started to integrate with the memories</p>
        <p>After 10 minutes i woke up, the mature aura around me disappears, my movements starts to change and each of my action started to resemble a childs</p>
        <p>opening my eyes stong determination started to flow through me, today onwards i am Austin,</p>
        <p>Austin Lionheart</p>
        <p>suddenly the door to my room opens and a women walks in, seeing her for a moment i fall in to daze.</p>
        <p>blonde hair that falls to her shoulder, green eyes that shined like gems, a plump lips along with a motherly aura</p>
        <p>Grace Lionheart my mother walks in,although i had seen her in my memory seeing for real is totally another experience</p>
        <p>Grace looked towards her child and for a moment she felt that her child felt diffrent, like a stranger.</p>
        <p>‘what am i thinking, looks like the stress is getting to me’</p>
        <p>shrugging her thoughts she walk towards her child</p>
        <p>seeing my so called mom stop for a moment and frowning my heart starts beating faster and cold sweat appeared on my back</p>
        <p>‘Does she know?, no maybe she felt something was different?, i really need to get my act together’</p>
        <p>Finishing my monologue i look towards my mother and began my act</p>
        <p>“little Austy are you alright?, i got scared when you suddenly fainted”</p>
        <p>saying so my mother approaches me and pulls me into her embrace and i directly falls into her pillow like breast and a sweet scent enters my nose.</p>
        <p>‘umm smells like roses, wait that’s not important did she say faint?’</p>
        <p>i started to look through my memory and found out that i had fainted during my breakfeast</p>
        <p>placing my hands on my mothers breast</p>
        <p>(by accident) to pull my self up i look towards my mother and smiling i said</p>
        <p>“its nothing mom,its just that i have some headache, but i am fine now”</p>
        <p>seeing that her son was fine now Grace gave a happy smile</p>
        <p>“then its all good, i had a healer check up on you and she said that you are alright”</p>
        <p>“Humph….how can he not be okay, he is the one who always survives after all”</p>
        <p>after the loud shout two girls walked into my room one a 10 year old and the other a 6 year old</p>
        <p>And i know the one who had spoken now,</p>
        <p>Nora Lionheart</p>
        <p>my big sister and one of the capture targets</p>
