        <p>Chapter 12: The Shop’s Product’s</p>
        <p>Hey Guys!!!</p>
        <p>I made a small changes to how the status is shown</p>
        <p>Hope you guys accept it?</p>
        <p>………….…</p>
        <p>it’s been a week since the day i had my first chess match with my big sister</p>
        <p>“checkmate again sis”</p>
        <p>i said giving my disappointed sister sitting across me an innocent smile, my smile furthered her anger of disappointment.</p>
        <p>“How can you always win against me, i am the older one here”</p>
        <p>my sister raised her arms and screamed in indignation, she had been having chess matches with me all week and yet till now she hasn’t won</p>
        <p>“you know what this means right?”</p>
        <p>“yeah, yeah i know, so what should i do?”</p>
        <p>her answer furthered my smile, when me and my sis had played for the 2nd time i had asked her to keep a bet, a simple one the loser will do one thing the winner want’s</p>
        <p>since i kept on winning, she had to do what i want, i didn’t ask anything big, as much as i want her to get down on her knees and give my dick a blowjob</p>
        <p>i can’t do it, first i can’t let my babies loose and second it might destroy the relationship i right now have with her, so i asked her to do small stuffs right now, maybe who nows it might lead to something</p>
        <p>“how about you give me a massage sis”</p>
        <p>giving me a stink eye she stood up came behind me and gave me a some what amateurish massage, it didn’t feel all that great but getting my smug sister to do something i want in it’s self is a pleasure</p>
        <p>after making fun my sis a bit i head towards my room, i got something important to do today, entering my room and giving the command that no one can enter it, i open the shop</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>item: The founder</p>
        <p>Description: An amazing item created by the omerian tribes, said to make the body stronger and create an unshakable foundation</p>
        <p>cost:30,000</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>This is something i am planning to buy now, in the world of Ether, people can embark on the road of strenght after you reach 10 years when your foundations created</p>
        <p>normally its only when you 10 year old when your foundation or your plate is created, you can start cultivating your power</p>
        <p>But at times there are said to be people whose foundation are completed early, they are an extremely small group of people said to be geniuses and have great connection with mana</p>
        <p>of course i am no genuis but i have the cheat named the system, so suck it geniuses!!!</p>
        <p>after that i take a look at my system</p>

        <p>Total Points: 52,000</p>
        <p>Looks:9/10(not bad you can live with just your looks)</p>

        <p>Titles: None</p>
        <p>Partners Conquered: None</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>52,000 the culmination of the points i earned this last 2 weeks and with it i will take the first step of my plan.</p>
        <p>“system i want to buy the founder”</p>
        <p>[Request accepted]</p>
        <p>[Do you wish to buy The Founder: Y/N]</p>
        <p>i click yes and the familiar white light appears again and forms a container in my hands, it was blue colored cylindrical container, containing a green liquid floating in it</p>
        <p>“system am i to drink this?”</p>
        <p>[The host must shake it a bit first then drink it, the effect will take place during your sleep]</p>
        <p>what else can i do other than trust the system, shaking the container a bit, i opened it, unlike what i expected there was no smell, praying to all the gods i can think of, i take the container and in one sip, took it all in.</p>
        <p>to all the curious mind out there the solution tasted a bit like kiwi</p>
        <p>‘umm, the taste is not bad’</p>
        <p>waiting for something to happen i brace my self but, even after a few minutes nothing happened</p>
        <p>“hey system what happend??, shouldnt i go all super saiyan or somthing??”</p>
        <p>[As i said before host, host must take a rest and during your sleep the portion will readily built your foundation for you]</p>
        <p>shrugging my shoulders and hiding my small disappointment in not able to have my childish outburst i retire for my sleep in excitement</p>
        <p>i can’t help it after all, no mater how mature i can be the prospect of using magic is simply an allure i can’t let go, forcing myself i slowly fall into slumber.</p>
