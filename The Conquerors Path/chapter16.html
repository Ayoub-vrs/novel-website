        <p>Chapter 16: I am not her opponent</p>
        <p>Grace pov:</p>
        <p>currently i am going through the documents about the dukedom, ever since the death of my husband its only been me holding the fort down.</p>
        <p>thinking about my husband Austin comes to mind, that boy he has grown a lot these days, thinking about him i remember the report given about his trip outside</p>
        <p>to think Austin wanted to be a bow user and to think that i didn’t know it, to become a bow user to provide support and protection, he’s just like his father unknowingly a smile formed on my face</p>
        <p>‘sigh they are growing up so fast without me even knowing’</p>
        <p>‘i need to investigate that women who owns the shop, Mia had said that her strength might be above origin level 8’</p>
        <p>And that idiot son of mine want to learn cooking to provide for me, i chuckle a little at this, that boy is too much of a softie</p>
        <p>while i was in my thought, i suddenly felt a presence in my room, i jump up from my seat and started creating a shield</p>
        <p>a person capable of entering the room without my knowledge is not at all simple</p>
        <p>then i saw in front of me a women in a one piece dress and a vile covering her face, giving out a graceful aura</p>
        <p>‘she’s!!’</p>
        <p>i suddenly felt a dreadful feeling as if the world was pressing on to me, as a person who had been to the battlefield i can at once say that i am not at all her match</p>
        <p>‘An imperial’</p>
        <p>coming to my conclusion i became more respectful, an imperial be it any are people capable of affecting the world</p>
        <p>“what does an esteem imperial want from me?”</p>
        <p>i asked in a respectful tone</p>
        <p>she indifferently waved her hand</p>
        <p>“dont be still i am not here to kill you or anything”</p>
        <p>“i came here to tell you one thing, i wish to take your son as my disciple”</p>
        <p>“What!!”</p>
        <p>I exclaim in surprise</p>
        <p>‘An imperial wants to take my son as a disciple’</p>
        <p>no matter how much lax she said it, the very possibility of someone becoming the disciple of an imperial is a very huge thing</p>
        <p>being the disciple of an imperial is basically a rise to the life of a king, it means that you have a chance of becoming an imperial yourself while receiving the protection of an imperial</p>
        <p>i tried to control my emotions by taking deep breaths, after a few minutes i controlled my self but my heart was still beating in excitement</p>
        <p>“why do you want to take my son as your disciple?”</p>
        <p>imperials don’t just simply take disciples there had to be somthing special about them, just what is so special about her son??</p>
        <p>instead of answering me she looked me up and down with a questioning gaze</p>
        <p>“you don’t know??”</p>
        <p>“know what?”</p>
        <p>“That your son has finished his foundation, that he’s reached tier 3 and that his plate is rank 10”</p>
        <p>silence…</p>
        <p>“haa, looks like i haven’t been sleeping well, i am starting to hear things nowadays too”</p>
        <p>“i am not joking you know”</p>
        <p>i freeze and look directly into her eyes as if asking her what i heard is true and i receive a nod back, this time i am totally floored</p>
        <p>just when did her child become such a monster??</p>
        <p>i take a seat in my chair to get some support, i tried taking control of my emotions by taking deep breaths, after a few minutes i got my bearing back</p>
        <p>‘to think my so was such a talent and i didn’t know about it, am i such a bad mother??’</p>
        <p>pushing such thoughts away i start to focus on the topic at hand, an imperial wants to take my son as her disciple, it will grant him protection and seeing who i am talking to her character is good to</p>
        <p>“so does the bow empress think, my son has the talent to inherit her bow?”</p>
        <p>“dont worry, your sons talent in the bow is great to”</p>
        <p>hearing that i give out a sigh</p>
        <p>“i have no problem with you being Austin’s teacher but Austin has to agree to it”</p>
        <p>“that’s no problem”</p>
        <p>with that she disappeared from in front of me, it’s only then that i could take a deep breath to calm myself and than i noticed that i was covered with sweat</p>
        <p>‘dealing with an imperial no joke, i should take a bath’</p>
        <p>with that i head towards the shower</p>
        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
        <p>Austin pov:</p>
        <p>“say ahhhh”</p>
        <p>+20 affection</p>
        <p>right now i am feeding my little sister and filling in my daily dose of affection points while planning my next move, suddenly i felt a pull on my shirt and looks down and saw my sister looking at me</p>
        <p>“what is it??”</p>
        <p>“u-um brother can i sleep with you today?”</p>
        <p>“sure why not”</p>
        <p>after sleeping with me for the first time, Elda some times comes and sleeps with me, it doesn’t hurt to have a cute little girl laying on your embrace so i always agree to it</p>
        <p>it was during this time that i got a summons from my mother so i head towards her.Entering the room there was another person, yup it’s Eleanor</p>
        <p>‘um, it’s time to begin the act’</p>
        <p>when i entered two pair of eyes moves towards me, smiling i ran into my mothers embrace, giving her a hug</p>
        <p>“what is it mother?”</p>
        <p>“its nothing i just wanted you to meet someone”</p>
        <p>saying so she pointed at Eleanor who was seated in a chair, “surprised” i responded</p>
        <p>“what are you doing here bis sis??”</p>
        <p>i am pretty sure that i saw my mothers lips twitch when i called her big sis</p>
        <p>“its nothing, i just came to ask if you would be interested in learning to use the bow from me?”</p>
        <p>“use the bow?”</p>
        <p>i turn to my mother “confused” as if couldn’t understand what she was saying to me</p>
        <p>“do you know who this big sister in front of you is?”</p>
        <p>my mother asked</p>
        <p>i shook my head</p>
        <p>“the person in front of you is the bow empress, an imperial”</p>
        <p>“what!”</p>
        <p>i shouted in “suprise”</p>
        <p>i turned towards Elenanor my eyes displaying “admiration” towards her, seeing this Grace felt a bit sour in her heart as if her sons love is being slowly sipped away</p>
        <p>seeing my “admiration” Eleanor smiles, ‘good, looks like my disciple knows respect’</p>
        <p>“are you really the bow empress, will you really teach me to be amazing as you”,</p>
        <p>i asked in “excitment”</p>
        <p>“if you be my disciple, of course i will teach you”</p>
        <p>i nodded in exitment as if i couldn’t wait to take her as my teacher, seeing me nodding so readily Eleanor smile widens</p>
        <p>“Good then from tommorrow onwards i will be your teacher”</p>
