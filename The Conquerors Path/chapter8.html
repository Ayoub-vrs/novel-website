        <p>Chapter 8: The Great Shop</p>
        <p>bloodlines unlike what you think they are not hereditary, you might or might not be born with a bloodline, it all depends on luck</p>
        <p>Bloodlines can either be a curse or a blessing that’s because not all bloodlines are good or helpful, some might even cause harm</p>
        <p>Also there is only a small chance that a person might even activate their bloodline, always being born with it does not mean that one might awaken it</p>

        <p>Along with these there were several other spells which had left me flustered, these were really useful spell, especially for me.</p>
        <p>making a mental note of what i should buy later when i have points i moved towards the combat shop, the stuff there really did impress me</p>
        <p>[</p>

        <p>]</p>
        <p>There were also several other products that impressed me, there was even one that awakened hidden bloodlines but the price of it had pushed the notion away</p>
        <p>while i was examining my options the door to the library opens and my maid Mia enters</p>
        <p>“young master, its already time for your lunch plus you still have to meet with the young miss”</p>
        <p>its only after i heard her speak that i understood that its already evening, standing up i said</p>
        <p>” Sure lets go, also say to my sister that we can have lunch together today”</p>
        <p>“yes, young master”</p>
        <p>Few minute later i was situated in the dining hall with my sister across me</p>
        <p>seeing her i was quite unsure on how to begin, then when i saw what was severed for luch, it was lamb based and then a idea hit me</p>
        <p>“Mia”</p>
        <p>“yes, young master”</p>
        <p>“take my seat towards my sister i will cut and feed her lamb for her today”</p>
        <p>My dominant voice and suggestion suprised the maids gathered in the hall but they recovered fast and carried out my order.</p>
        <p>now i was seated near my very suprised sister who was looking at like i was some kind of alien.</p>
        <p>chuckling i patted her head</p>
        <p>“dont worry little Edla, your big brother here will feed you today”</p>
        <p>hearing my words she shyly nodded her head but suddenly a scene happend which suprised me</p>
        <p>+50 affection</p>
        <p>seeing the light pop up above her head, i went into daze for a moment, recovering quickly i read her info again</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Name: Elda Lionheart</p>
        <p>Age: 6</p>
        <p>Talent:9/10</p>
        <p>Title: None</p>
        <p>power: null</p>
        <p>Love: 67%(sibling love)</p>
        <p>Description: wants to get close to her big brother but doesn’t know how.Looks a bit down on you due to your wimpy side.</p>
        <p>>desires to play with her big brother</p>
        <p>Difficulty:B+(she is a child if you play your cards right, she’s yours)</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>Her love had gone up by 1%, ‘umm, this is good looks like i can use her to experiment’</p>
        <p>continuing, i started to cut her food to serve her and tenderly i served her like she was the most tender and fragile gem</p>
        <p>+25 affection</p>
        <p>+15 affection</p>
        <p>+20 affection</p>
        <p>And as i continued to feed her, the more points i started to rack in, she was like an ATM that gave money and i was the recipient who needed it dearly</p>
        <p>while feeding her, i began to doubt her display of affection, sure its fun to be with your big brother and all but it doesn’t explain such display</p>
        <p>Then it suddenly hit me, she was feeling lonely, having a mother diving into her job, a big sister fully busy with her schedule, she didn’t have anybody to play with</p>
        <p>having come to the realization a evil smirk came and went upon my face</p>
        <p>‘Looks like conquering her will be easier than i thought’</p>
        <p>looking into the green eyes of my sister, i tenderly took a napkin and cleaned her face</p>
        <p>+50 affection</p>
        <p>After luch i took my little sister around to play we played many games, while i told her about the stories and funny jokes from earth, by the end i had racked a great amount of points</p>
        <p>It was only when the maid had reminded us that we choose to seprate and head to bed but before leaving i gave my little sister a hug and a kiss on the forehead after which she ran away shy from my affection</p>
