        <p>Chapter 33: Chaos(4)</p>
        <p>Hey Guys!!</p>
        <p>I am sorry about the late chapters my exams have began and I have less time to write the chapter.</p>
        <p>I only started writing to blow my stress and boredom and since my exams began the posting rate might decrease.</p>
        <p>Don’t worry I am not stopping, I will post a minimum of 3 chaps per week till my exams finish</p>
        <p>Thank you for all your supports?</p>
        <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
        <p>the third round had began, this time there were total of 8 humanoids which had appeared, 4 of them carrying swords, 2 of them spears and the other 2 unarmed just like before</p>
        <p>‘damn it, looks like i have to start using mana spells’</p>
        <p>the time all 8 of them appeared they started running towards me, taking 2 arrows i placed them on the bow and applied two spells to it {haste} and {penetration}</p>
        <p>after that i fired both the arrows, the 1st one travelled so fast that it pierced both the unarmed humanoids in a blink while the 2nd arrow travelled to the armed swords-mans where the 1st one got pierced and the 2nd swordsman lost an arm</p>
        <p>Just as I finished firing the arrows one of the spear holder then threw a spear at me doging it,i was greeted with the sight of a humanoid waving another spear at me</p>
        <p>dodging it also i put a bit of distance between me and them at the same time i took out a small throwing knife from my pocket imbued a bit of mana into it and threw it at the now armless humanoid who directly lost it’s life</p>
        <p>now i was surrounded with 2 sword and 2 spear wielding humanoids who had started to surround me, and before they could do anything i blasted a smoke bomb in my place covering everything with smoke</p>
        <p>as i was covered with smoke i activated my eyes of truth, as my eyes was covering with gold and black i could see the small green and red dots on 4 humanoids surrounding</p>
        <p>this was somthing which i had found out recently not only can i use the eyes of truth not only to see sensitive spots but also their weaknesses</p>
        <p>as soon as i activated it i took out an arrow and fired it at a spear holding humanoid who died directly, while i got hurt by one of the swordsman who just slashed at random</p>
        <p>‘bastard!’</p>
        <p>directly taking out 3 arrows i added {haste} and {blast} to it which directly blasted the other 3 humainds</p>
        <p>the spectator’s watched as the spoke subsided, showing a mildly hurt Austin</p>
        <p>“Austin!”</p>
        <p>“big brother!”</p>
        <p>hearing my sisters call i looked towards them and saw their worrying face but i just gave them a reassuring smile, while i hid my nervousness inside, and like that the next 5 minutes passed fast</p>
        <p>as the bell rang for the 4th round, this time 12 figures appeared 4 swordsman, 4 spearman, 2 unarmed and 2 bowman’s!!</p>
        <p>‘damn it, long range was my speciality, looks like its compromised’</p>
        <p>‘looks like it’s time to get serious’</p>
        <p>thinking so i took out an arrow, i then gathered most of my mana into it, looking i could see the bowman’s arranging their arrow and the rest running towards me</p>
        <p>‘take this you bastards’</p>
        <p>“{arrows fall}!”</p>
        <p>saying so i fired the arrow with all my mana, the arrow flew out of the bow at the same time it divided into thousands of arrows raining upon them, within minutes all of them were killed</p>
        <p>after that i sat on the floor</p>
        <p>‘Ha…ha…ha….wow it really is a crazy move!’</p>
        <p>most of my mana and strenght was taken away with that move but its not much of a problem, smiling i brought a container from the system and qucikly it was delivered to my hands</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Item: The Rejuvenation</p>
        <p>Description: A potion made by the portion master Markas</p>
        <p>uses: by ingesting it all your mana and injuries will be healed</p>
        <p>cost: 3000</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>this is one of the reason for my confidence, as long as i fire the spell continously like this and drink this portion i might pass this trail</p>
        <p>without any delay i quickly drank it, suddenly i felt all the stress ans pain leave me and my lost mana filling me up, after that i sat up in meditation to reagin my focus and like that 5 minutes went just like that</p>
        <p>juat as the bell rang figures started to appaer and this time there was 20 figures!, 4 swordsman, 4 spearman, 4 bowman’s, 4 of them unarmed and 4 mages??</p>
        <p>‘the hell?, did i miss a level or what?’</p>
        <p>while i was in my own world all the 20 heads was turned towards me, their eyes which was their only distinct feature was shining looking at me, seeing their eyes i got goosebumps on my body</p>
        <p>just as i was planning to continue my same tactics, the 4 mages raised their hands and started chanting, just as i was about to disrupt them, several arrows fell from the sky</p>
        <p>seeing it i quickly created barriers while doging the arriving arrows at the same time, just at that time the castings by the mages were done, as it finished huge fireballs and other elements started to fall</p>
        <p>‘shit!’</p>
        <p>seeing that there was no way to dodge i quickly created a barrier and hardened my body, several of the spells fell on the barrier while the rest scratched my body, just as the spells finished arrows, swords and spears greeted me, i could hear my sisters shouting</p>
        <p>‘fuck!, so you wanna play dirty?’</p>
        <p>‘system, buy me 5 of the frost, flame, chaos and void arrows now!’</p>
        <p>[Request heard…processing request]</p>
        <p>[Ding!]</p>
        <p>[items brought, 100,000 points withdrawn]</p>
        <p>hearing this my heart bled, so many points gone just like that, as i was inwardly crying different arrows started to show up on my quiver</p>
        <p>without hesitation i pulled the frost arrow</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Item: Frost Arrow</p>
        <p>Description: An arrow made by the great blacksmith Loki</p>
        <p>uses: it’s an AOE based arrow, which when once fired blocks your enemies in ice for 10 seconds</p>
        <p>cost: 5000</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>distancing my self from the attacks i drew two frost arrows, added {multiply} to them and fired, the 2 arrows were quickly divided into 6 arrows landing in different areas, in a second the battlefield became a frozen land in which all of them were frozen</p>
        <p>wasting no time i quicly brought in my remaining mana, brought out a normal arrow and quickly fired {arrows fall} instantly breaking the ice and killing all the enemies</p>
        <p>after that i sat onto the floor, currently i have some broken ribs and am bleeding from several areas, i can still hear my sisters shouting from behind me, quickly i brought portion and quickly drank it, this time the healing and mana recovery process was much slower</p>
        <p>Turing around i saw Elda crying her heart out and the usually non expressive Nora had tears rolling down her eyes, to them i just gave a small smile, while on the viewing room it was unusually quiet</p>
        <p>“we-were bow users normally this strong?”</p>
        <p>one of the people in the room finally spoke, breaking the eerie silence</p>
        <p>“it’s not just him, the arrows and Product’s he used are extraordinary”</p>
        <p>Bruce who had seen much of the world was the first to clarify the situation</p>
        <p>“maybe he had got it from the Bow Empress but each item he use is very rare and powerful”</p>
        <p>“not only that but Austin himself is dealing with the problem impeccably, each move of his is coordinated and planned making even the simplest of moves deadly”</p>
        <p>Bruce was extremely impressed to say the least, Austin could said to be a born warrior, while others were praising him Grace was tearfully and worriedly looking at her son who was hurt and bleeding</p>
        <p>without knowing that the fight was just beginning</p>
