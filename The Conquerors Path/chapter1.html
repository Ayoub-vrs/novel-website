        <p>Chapter 1: the beginning</p>
        <p>
          In the azraeil empire, within the duchess’s castle of the human realm
          there lays a boy within the mansion of the duchess’s.The boy appears
          to be asleep within the bedroom, the room was the exact definition of
          the word “extravagant”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The room was decorated with gold on the edges of the room with a wide
          space for at least 7 people to live.The boy appears to be about 8
          years old with silver hair, Cubby cheeks,and a cute face.No doubt the
          boy would surely grow up to be quite the looker.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would have been a harmonious scene if it weren’t for the boy
          continuously frowning and Turing in the bed as if he was in pain. The
          boy kept groaning until suddenly he jolts up clutching His head.
        </p>
        <p>“What the hell, why does my head hurt so bad, what’s going on?”</p>
        <p>“Arhhhhh….damn it, it hurts…..”</p>
        <p>
          The “boy” suddenly jolts and starts Turing and tussling as if in great
          pain….
        </p>
        <p>
          “Why does it feels like my mind is exploding…what’s happening?.?..?”
        </p>
        <p>
          He kept on screaming in pain for at least 10 minutes until the “boy”
          had gotten better…..
        </p>
        <p>
          “Wow…uff, must have drunk a lot last night”the boy said currently
          lying flat on the floor,when he starts to realize that the sealing he
          is lookin at doesn’t belong to him
        </p>
        <p>
          “What the helll? Did I drink so much that I came to the wrong house or
          am I hallucinating now?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying to stand up the boy fails and falls back. “Damn it my, muscles
          hurt like hell! did I get into a bar fight,no..no that’s not
          important, the question is where the hell am I?”
        </p>
        <p>
          while laying down questing himself the boy notices a certain
          characteristic that he had failed to notice before, that is…everything
          looks big
        </p>
        <p>
          no that cant be right,the truth was he became smaller,feeling a sense
          of dread coming upon him the “boy” raises his hands and takes a look
        </p>
        <p>small,white and most of all smooth</p>
        <p>
          suddenly a certain thought enters his mind, a concept which was
          extremly popular among light novels and webnovels
        </p>
        <p>
          as an avid reader himself he had read his fair share of fantasy
          transmigaration novels
        </p>
        <p>
          “no, it cant be real, its not possible” while the boy was having a
          meltdown and was trying his best to push such thoughts away.
        </p>
        <p>a voice was heard, nailing his fantasies to reality</p>
        <p>[ding…]</p>
        <p>[scaning the current world…..]</p>
        <p>[scaning completed…]</p>
        <p>[welcome host!!!…..to your new life]</p>
        <p>
          the system joyfully said not knowing that these words had destroyed
          the building hope within his host
