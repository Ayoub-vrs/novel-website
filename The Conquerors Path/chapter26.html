        <p>Chapter 26: Time Skip</p>
        <p>3 years later~~~~~~~</p>
        <p>it’s been 3 years since i came to this world currently i am 11 years old and am going through the files about the dukedom</p>
        <p>yup, you heard right, i am dealing with the affairs of the dukedom, a year ago i asked my mother if i could help her with her work, at first she didn’t agree but later on she gave in</p>
        <p>after all i had earned the title of a genius in studies, my teacher’s couldn’t stop praising how smart i was,leaving the boasting aside after i took part in her work the time she spend on her work decreased</p>
        <p>we got to spend more time as a family and all of us became closer, these few years had been a crazy year and a lot had happened</p>
        <p>first of all Clara had awakened her bloodline shocking the people of the house, taking my eyes of the document i look towards the girl standing beside me</p>
        <p>she looked 11 year old, she had black hair tied in a pony tail and brown eyes, what was different about her was the 2 small horns poking in her head instead of looking bad it gave her a cute look</p>
        <p>her face though still immature and cute, no one could deny that’s she would be a beauty in the future, unlike how she was a few years ago, the girl right now stood both proud and elegant</p>
        <p>she wore a maid uniform, the chest which was flat had a small sign of protrusion, her eyes whenever she looked at me was full of love and subservience, overall she had changed</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Name: Clara</p>
        <p>Sex: Female</p>
        <p>Age: 11</p>
        <p>species: Human(partial demon)</p>
        <p>Talent: 8/10</p>
        <p>>booldline awakened: demonic darkness</p>
        <p>Power: origin level 1</p>

        <p>>she wants to nothing more than to spend eternity with you</p>
        <p>>trains harder than anyone to be worthy of you</p>
        <p>Remark: what have you done??</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>yup…..i went a bit overboard with her, during her awakening of her bloodline her chances of survival itself was small so I had to buy something called the pearl of darkness to help her succeed</p>
        <p>Also due to her awakening a demonic bloodline there were a lot of problems to, so at that time I stood beside her</p>
        <p>The act of me using a “priceless” treasure to help her and standing beside her gave me a lot of affection but I might have gone a bit overboard</p>
        <p>her love for me increases no matter what i do, as for her titles, i pretend as if i don’t see it.</p>
        <p>suddenly the door to the room opens and two girls enter one having black hair and the other white, its the fox girls</p>
        <p>they to have changed during this time both of them had grown taller, the aura of depression they had is completely gone, what replaced it was a fierce aura covering them</p>
        <p>“bohoo, master your always in the room, why don’t you come and play with us”</p>
        <p>“yes, we would like it if you could take some rest”</p>
        <p>Mika who entered first spoke supported by Rika</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Name: Mika</p>
        <p>Sex: Female</p>
        <p>Age: 11</p>

        <p>]</p>
        <p>[</p>
        <p>Name: Rika</p>
        <p>Sex: Female</p>
        <p>Age: 11</p>
        <p>species: white wolf beastwomen</p>

        <p>Title: water mage, loved mage</p>
        <p>Love : 100%</p>
        <p>Description: in her heart your position is unshakable</p>
        <p>>her shy character over the years has dissapeared, she strives to express her feelings for you</p>
        <p>Remark: both the sisters??, enjoy bro</p>
        <p>]</p>
        <p>both Rika’s and Mika’s feeling had grown a large margin this is mainly because of the support i had given them</p>
        <p>a year ago when they saw that their plate was still not forming they had gone into despair but i was there and completely supported them at that time ,so i was able to rack in more affection</p>
        <p>My mother actually was very surprised to say the least, having one person with talent such as theirs would be a blessing but there were 3 of them, she couldn’t stop smiling for some time</p>
        <p>leaving my documents i looked for the time, seeing that it’s late i stood up and stretched</p>
        <p>“seeing that its late i don’t mind taking a break”</p>
        <p>saying so i began to walk but suddenly both Mika and Rika came to my side and took my shoulders, Mika on my right and Rika on the left their still developing breasts pressed against my hands</p>
        <p>“girl’s what are you doing?”</p>
        <p>“we are just giving you a support to walk”</p>
        <p>“yup that’s right just a support”</p>
        <p>Mika spoke and Rika assuered</p>
        <p>“Girl’s do you think i am an old man that i need your support to walk?”</p>
        <p>“we are just protecting you”</p>
        <p>“yup that’s right”</p>
        <p>‘protect me??, girl’s who’s going to harm me inside my own dukedom surrounding by an army, can’t you girl’s make a better excuse’</p>
        <p>suddenly i felt a hug on by back and a voice is heard</p>
        <p>“ohh, c’mon don’t you all just hug Austin, you might make him irritated”</p>
        <p>“Clara you don’t have the right to speak here, your always with him while we are training”</p>
        <p>“yeah that’s right, you are always hording him, give us some time with him”</p>
        <p>like this thier conversation goes on</p>
        <p>‘girl’s am i not still here??, sigh…’</p>
        <p>this is one of the problem that arose with their affection, they publicly started to display their affection for me not hiding it</p>
        <p>there were countless times when my mother made fun of me about it, plus there was a small rumor going around that i am a playboy to</p>
        <p>i haven’t responded to their feeling yet but they are adamant on being with me, of course i won’t reject them but the time is not right</p>
        <p>but the biggest problem right now are my sister’s, their love towards had reached 100% but the problem is that the love still remains “sibling love”</p>
        <p>i had tried many things but it still remains the same but my instincts tell me that it was just the calm before the storm, i get the feeling that once it changes the points would flow in</p>
        <p>i could at least proudly say that i had turned them into bro cons, while they were still bickering i got tired and made my move</p>
        <p>i took my hand from the Mika’s and Rika’s grip, my hand them held thier waist, my sudden movements suprised them</p>
        <p>“Austin ?” They both asked</p>
        <p>without answering them i gave a mysterious smile and then suddenly gave both Mika’s and Rika’s cheeks a kiss, which stunned them both</p>
        <p>“A-Austin you”</p>
        <p>both the girl’s looked at me surprised this was the first time that i had responded to their advances but then they suddenly blushed from the kiss</p>
        <p>while i was enjoying their shy look i felt a huge aura of jealousy coming from behind me, i look back to see a pouting Clara, smiling wryly i let both the girl’s go from my arm’s and turn around</p>
        <p>without giving her anytime to react i pulled her and gave a kiss on her cheeks too, now i had 3 cute girl’s blushing and surrounding me</p>
        <p>when i felt that i need to do some more a maid suddenly dashes into the room</p>
        <p>“yo-young master!, the eldest miss sh-she”</p>
        <p>before the maid could finish i had already dashed towards my sister’s room, entering it i was greeted with the sight of both my sister’s laying on the bed in pain</p>
        <p>“mom what happened?”</p>
        <p>i directly asked about the situation to my mother, there were a bunch of healers in the room dealing with the situation</p>
        <p>“sigh…it’s nothing severe it’s s juat that both of your sister’s are awakening thier bloodline”</p>
        <p>but when Grace said this there was no happiness in her expression, only fear and helplessness</p>
        <p>‘both of them at the same time?, how is that possible?”</p>
