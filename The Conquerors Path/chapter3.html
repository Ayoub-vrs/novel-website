        <p>Chapter 3: Understanding</p>
        <p>Hello everyone</p>
        <p>from now onwards the story will forward on first person pattern</p>
        <p>So please enjoy !!</p>
        <p>****************************************************************************************************</p>
        <p>“What how is that possible, wa-wats goin on??, are you saying that i am in the game ‘Arizinons sense’ ?”</p>
        <p>[Yes and No, this world is real not a game ]</p>
        <p>while trying to digest the explosive news that i got right now i plunge directly to my bed</p>
        <p>‘Arizinons sense, Ether these words how could i not know them??’</p>
        <p>it was when i was on the 2nd year of highschool the game was released and just as it was released it had become a great hit</p>
        <p>Basically it was a eroge game…..</p>
        <p>Boasting about great capture targets,adventure, action and yes…we also have heart moving sex.</p>
        <p>It was basically a story of how you capture each targets and expand your harem as big as possible</p>
        <p>What had set this game different from others was how hard it was to capture the girls heart, each character felt like it had it’s own life.</p>
        <p>And instead of the normal route where we have a choice to pick to increase your favourable points, you could type your words and get diffrent responses</p>
        <p>The more you progress the more hard it gets as you had to work hard to keep your harem afloat.</p>
        <p>As a man of culture i had also played the game….secretly that is.</p>
        <p>well i could have said to be the topmost player as i had the largest harem and could keep it afloat.</p>
        <p>The feeling of conquering the heroines was so addictive that i couldn’t stop playing and ended up becoming a pro who conquered many girls that others could not.</p>
        <p>“so what you are basically saying is i was reborn in the game but why?”</p>
        <p>i was really curious why did i get a second chance why me?</p>
        <p>[well host to start with, this is your game world but real,there will be no 2nd chances, no restarts and no retreats]</p>
        <p>[The action host takes will effect the future and everybody here are real and have feelings]</p>
        <p>[As to why you are here it is bcause of the god of games]</p>
        <p>“god of games??, are you saying that a god gave me this chance why”</p>
        <p>[the god of games is one of the supreme gods in existence, as to the chance the god of games gave you is not free]</p>
        <p>“wait not free,what do you mean?”</p>
        <p>[Ding..]</p>
        <p>[main quest intiated:</p>
        <p>Info: Take all the girls away from the main protagonist, take all the girls for yourself while making sure that the protagonist lives a full life of a bachelor</p>
        <p>Rewad:Getting to freely live in this world</p>
        <p>Faliure: To have your soul completely totured for eternity in hell]</p>
        <p>Reading the main quest i got, i had only one thought in his mind</p>
        <p>that i was f****d up!!</p>
        <p>while taking all the women for himself and living a harem life does sound great, it definitely has a huge backlash</p>
        <p>one must know that the game was almost similar to reality where only you could know the result after the action.</p>
        <p>As an eroge the game had the tsundere, the sadist, the machoist, the kuudere and the…yandere</p>
        <p>Dont take me wrong i have nothing against yanderes, in fact which man doesn’t love it when a women will do anything for you and live just for you?</p>
        <p>But when the love leads to the women activating a god-tier forbbiden magic to keep you for herself, thats when shit hits the fan.</p>
        <p>Remembering the look of the women who was manically laughing after proclaiming him only hers caused a tremble up my spine.</p>
        <p>“wait why did the god of game do this what’s in it for him?”</p>
        <p>[Host might not know this but as the god of game it is his responsibility to play all the released games and to completely conquer it]</p>
        <p>[However for the first time the God of Games couldn’t completely win in a game]</p>
        <p>“so, you mean that, since he couldnt complete “arizinons sense” he created the real world just to torture the protaganist?”</p>
        <p>[Correct host, as the choosen individual you must conquer each of the targets, while making the main hero life tougher]</p>
        <p>Hearing this i was really speechless, just because he was spiteful he wanted to torture the games main hero.</p>
        <p>“so basically i should take all the womens for myself while making the protagonist a bachelor”</p>
        <p>[yes]</p>
        <p>i was speechless, while what i said was easy completing it is almost close to impossible.</p>
        <p>Each of the capture targets either have immense background, power or beauty, who won’t settle for just any tom, dick or harry.</p>
        <p>sighing while rubbing my head, i choose to keep the problems temporarily on the back on my head and focus on the present.</p>
        <p>“can you atleast tell me who i am right now?”</p>
        <p>[Host has taken the body and have become the character Austin Lionheart]</p>
        <p>Hearing the name i jump out of my bed with not only shock but also fear.</p>
