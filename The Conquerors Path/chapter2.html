        <p>Chapter 2: New Start</p>
        <p>
          Hearing the words which he never hoped to hear his whole life the
          “boy” suddenly starts to cry.
        </p>
        <p>‘….. so i died’</p>
        <p>
          ‘how is that possible, tha last thing i remember is leaving my dorms
          to buy some groceries, and then….wait i can’t remember anything after
          that’
        </p>
        <p>reading the hosts thoughts the system replied</p>
        <p>
          [Host died after returning from shopping, host got caught between a
          shooting scene and got hit with a bullet, the memories of it are
          removed as to avoid psychological problems for the host!!]
        </p>
        <p>
          hearing the reply from his so called system, the “boy” starts crying
          even more
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘so i died without accomplishing anything in life?, without giving
          back the love and support my parents gave me?, without accomplishing
          my dreams?’
        </p>
        <p>[warning…warning…</p>
        <p>mentality of the host breaking down ..</p>
        <p>activating emergancy cool down procedures]</p>
        <p>
          suddenly the “boy” feels a cooling sensation on him and his dark
          thoughts some how started to settle down
        </p>
        <p>
          [Host you might have died but now you have the chance to write you
          future again please calm down, take deep breaths]
        </p>
        <p>
          feeling his sanity some back to him, his hazy eyes started to gain
          it’s clarity back.
        </p>
        <p>
          taking deep breaths the boy tries to stand up in which he miserable
          fails and falls back
        </p>
        <p>laying on the carpet the carpet the “boy” asks</p>
        <p>
          “so how was it back at my home,is everybody alright…. a-ar-are my
          parents alright?”
        </p>
        <p>
          [Host parents are alright, there were at your funeral and your parents
          did fall into depression but they will lauch back]
        </p>
        <p>
          hearing what the system said the boy heaves a sigh “give me some time
          alone to think”
        </p>
        <p>
          hearing what his host said and reading his hosts mental state the
          sytem became silent
        </p>
        <p>
          closing his eyes the boy began to remeber, his past, his life, his
          parents, everything, his total of 22 years old his life
        </p>
        <p>
          like this half an hour passed, when he opend his eyes again there were
          a myriad of emotion and he had not fully forgotten his past but he can
          now move forward.
        </p>
        <p>“hey system i am now ready, could you tell me why i can’t move?”</p>
        <p>finally hearing the word it wanted to hear,it replied</p>
        <p>
          [yes host we can start!!, currently the hosts soul is being conneted
          to the current body, since there is a mismatch of your soul and body
          it might take some time to integrate]
        </p>
        <p>
          [For worry not i can speed up the time by giving you current body some
          shock]
        </p>
        <p>
          hearing the first half of the systems words the “boy” smiled but
          hearing the rest his face started to contract.
        </p>
        <p>“how long will the normal route take??”</p>
        <p>[about 1 to 2 months]</p>
        <p>
          ‘so what you are basicly telling me is that i have to take the shock
          right??, how are these even options’
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking a deep breathe to control his rising anger, the boy replied
          “sure give those shocks”
        </p>
        <p>
          [right away host, better take a deep breathe for the coming shock in
          3..2…1!!]
        </p>
        <p>
          sudddenly the boys body starts twitching like a fish taken out of
          water, this went on for about 20 seconds before it cooled down
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘arhg…damn it, hey system why dont you come in font of me so that i
          can “thank you” ‘
        </p>
        <p>[No need host, i am an eternal figure you can’t touch me]</p>
        <p>
          Grumbling to himself the “boy” raises himself from the ground and
          takes a look around
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘seeing the furniture and room it seems like this boys family is quite
          rich’
        </p>
        <p>“hey system tell me where i am and who i am”</p>
        <p>[host better take a seat before i start]</p>
        <p>
          Hearing this the “boy” takes a seat on the bed ready to hear about
          himself
        </p>
        <p>
          [The host is currently in the world of “Ether” from “Arizinons sense”]
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing the systems word the “boy” shot up from his bed with deep
          shock
