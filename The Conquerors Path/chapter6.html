        <p>Chapter 6: Information</p>
        <p>“Young master, wake up”</p>
        <p>“wake up young master”</p>
        <p>Hearing a feminine voice calling me, my tiered eyes opened, the first thing i saw was a unfamiliar ceiling, for a moment i was confused then suddenly memories of yesterday flooded me</p>
        <p>‘i see, so it wasn’t a dream’</p>
        <p>waking up, i saw a women in traditional maid costume, with a nice curvey body and a mature aura and a cute face</p>
        <p>she was standing beside me waiting for me, feeling confused i racked through my brain looking for the memories of her</p>
        <p>‘huh, so her name is Mia and she was assigned to be my maid till my personal servent was determined’</p>
        <p>Here in the world of Ether each noble on their 9th birthday receives a personal maid or butler.</p>
        <p>shrugging these thoughts away i got out from my bed and giving her my most innocent smile, i said</p>
        <p>“Goodmoring Mia”</p>
        <p>“Goodmoring young master, its time for you to get freshened up”</p>
        <p>“sure, lets go”</p>
        <p>Giving her the signal, i was led to the bathroom where I was cleaned, rinsed and dressed up</p>
        <p>though it was weird to be cleaned and dressed by some else, but the mental plessue of having different maid clean you up really is great, though my body was young and it couldn’t have reactions, I was still an adult at mind.</p>
        <p>it was at that time that i understood how big the mansion i lived in really was, each and every corner screamed luxury</p>
        <p>Guess this is what you get when you are the sister of the emperor</p>
        <p>i was led by my maid to the dinning area where there was a large table filled with foods and saw my newly acquired family waiting for me</p>
        <p>it was a rule that all the family members would sit together for breakfast</p>
        <p>playing my current “Austin” persona i greeted each of my family, i really need to start changing his behaviour gradually.</p>
        <p>my mother and little sister smiled at me while my big sister pouted and looked away</p>
        <p>‘cute’ i thought</p>
        <p>i took my seat and started my breakfast, but damn it was really taste, it was nothing like what i had ever eaten, the food just melted in my mouth</p>
        <p>while having breakfast my mother asked me how i was and other question pertaining to my sickness, while i replied curtly matching my persona</p>
        <p>after breakfast everyone was left to do their own thing , my mother had to deal with her duties, my big sister to her training while my smaller one for studies.</p>
        <p>while being a noble and all sound good but it comes with its own responsiblity, kids had to start focusing and studying from a young age</p>
        <p>and each children is taught to bring out their most talents and potential, in this world noble children mature early due to their studies and responsibilities.</p>
        <p>before my little sis left i asked her to free her timing in the eveing so she could play with me.</p>
        <p>though suprised she readily agreed, since she’s only six she doesn’t have a lot to learn</p>
        <p>As for me since i am “sick” my mother asked me to take a week leave from studies</p>
        <p>since i was free i decided to head towards the library of the mansion as a man who belived that “knowledge is power” i really needed to know more about this world</p>
        <p>Entering the library i saw a large area fully covered by books, a room fully covered with books from top to bottom</p>
        <p>sending my maid away for privacy, i soon dived towards towards the books containing the basics of this world</p>
        <p>4 houres later~~~~~~~</p>
        <p>closing the 5th book, I leaned towards my chair and closed my eyes</p>
        <p>‘looks like the knowledge i know is similar to the worlds’</p>
        <p>as i said before this world is called Ether, the world was built by the two goddesses Silviya and Silvie, they both put towards their power and created the world they deemed fit.</p>
        <p>They created the Silviya realm and the Silvie realm.</p>
        <p>we have the Silviya realm, which currently contains several contries and two empires, along side the elves, beastmens and dwarfs.</p>
        <p>the elves have a single empire where they live in the olive forest and unlike the normal fantasy elves they aren’t tree huggers</p>
        <p>the elves had created a huge empire within the forest which was ruled by several tribes, the elves are known for their ablity for commerce and magical combat</p>
        <p>a large quantity of the worlds money flow through them, several businesses and banks are being controled by them.</p>
        <p>Not only that, due to their longer life span they also have a larger amount of experts, but they have no desire for world denomination</p>
        <p>why you ask??</p>
        <p>why would they, they have everything.</p>
        <p>“we got money, we got land and we are in prosperity!!”</p>
        <p>plus due to their innate magic capabilities they were being protected by the dragon’s</p>
        <p>here dragon’s are not an empire or a tribe thay are somthing much above it, dragons are on a different level.</p>
        <p>dragon’s were said to be the first created species of the both goddesses, with strength and life force above all other species.</p>
        <p>they dont intervene in wordly matter’s and they make sure that the peace stay.</p>
        <p>and hence the elves recieved the protection and support, no one was there that could stop them.</p>
